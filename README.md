<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project   

### Data Preprocessing

Filtering: Describe the criteria used for filtering the data.
Normalization: Explain the normalization technique applied to standardize the data.
Inverse Hyperbolic Transformation: Briefly discuss the purpose and method of the inverse hyperbolic transformation.
Mean Centering: Explain how mean centering was implemented to center the data around its mean.
### Visualization

Explain the visualization techniques used, namely PCA and MDS:

PCA (Principal Component Analysis): Describe how PCA was applied to reduce the dimensionality of the data and visualize it in a lower-dimensional space.
MDS (Multidimensional Scaling): Explain how MDS was used to visualize the proximity measures obtained from the unsupervised random forest.
Results : Summarize the results obtained from your analysis. Highlight any insights gained from the visualizations and the impact of the preprocessing techniques on the data.
